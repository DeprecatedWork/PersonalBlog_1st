### [Brum Hack 2.0](https://www.brumhack.co.uk/).

##### Location: University Of Birmingham

##### Date: 28/03/2015 - 29/03/2015

##### Project: Salary Radar

BrumHack 2.0 was a student hackathon based at The University of Birmingham. For this hack, I was part of a two man team retained data from the .gov websites on salaries of different professions across the UK for men and women. We then attempted to display this data on Google        Maps to show the difference in pay between men and women.
                     
For personal reason's we were unable to submit our work.
